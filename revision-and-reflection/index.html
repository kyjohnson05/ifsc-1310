      <p>It has been an exciting journey throughout this semester as I explored different ways of learning new coding languages and web technologies. I was particularly motivated by the chance to impress my peers and showcase my skills in creating dynamic and interactive web projects. Building websites offers countless opportunities for creative expression and technical mastery, two subjects Iâ€™ve taken interest in for the entirety of my life. Quite frankly, this course granted me a new hobby to experiment with and opened my eyes more to the world of computer science.</p>
      <p>I gained valuable experience in various areas of web development, including creating website animations using JavaScript, understanding the distinctions between coding languages, and using HTML tags effectively. My studies also taught me the importance of structuring files correctly, styling web pages with CSS, and navigating through GitHub as a creator. Additionally, I learned how to analyze and interpret web pages using inspect element in Google Chrome, which deepened my understanding of web design and functionality. To specify, if I forgot the functionalities of different tags in my code, I could right click on specific parts of the page and figure it out using inspect element. My younger self would simply mess around with the code until I found which part changed the background color of a page, but now I know where to go.</p>
      <p>Throughout the semester, I managed to implement a range of features on my websites, such as animations, unique fonts, creative backgrounds, parallax effects, logos with links, and a usual looking FAQ page. Organizing my code efficiently was essential to achieving a polished and user-friendly website. Such accomplishments reflect my growth and mastery of web technologies, resulting in an engaging and aesthetically pleasing user experience.</p>
      <p>If I were to start my SpaceX project over, I would focus on creating a true loading screen for my homepage rather than relying on a link from the course page. Additionally, I would prioritize ensuring the website is fully responsive and adaptable to various device screens. Managing to provide these improvements would enhance the overall user experience and make the website more accessible to a wider audience.</p>
      <p>The feedback I received from friends showed nothing but amazement, with many praising the advanced and visually appealing design of my website. Although my peers did not identify any major issues, I felt there was room for improvement and decided to add a loading screen for a more polished and professional touch. The adjustment enhanced the user experience and added an extra layer of satisfaction to my project.</p>
      <p>Reflecting on my journey, I am grateful for the opportunity to combine my technological skills with creativity, finding fulfillment in completing each assignment. The course provided a solid foundation in web development, motivating me to stay dedicated and focused. By pushing myself to meet the course requirements, I was able to develop a strong work ethic and a deeper appreciation for the world of web technologies.</p>
