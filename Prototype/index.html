    <h3>How The School Began</h3><!-- Header 3 -->

<p>The University of Arkansas at Little Rock (UALR) is a public research university stationed in Little Rock, Arkansas in 1927, initially as Little Rock Junior College and Little Rock University. </p><!-- Allows me to write words on the site -->
<blockquote>"The early years of the new junior college were guided by the dreams and diligence of LRJC founder, John A. Larson (president, 1930-1950). Despite limited funding, Larson was determined to see LRJC flourish. In 1929, his aspirations for expanding the junior college were fulfilled when former Arkansas Gov. George W. Donaghey named LRJC as the sole beneficiary of a trust valued in excess of $2 million. After several years of discussion and study, Little Rock University in September 1969 merged with the University of Arkansas to create the University of Arkansas at Little Rock." <cite><a href="https://ualr.edu/about/history/">(UALR)</a></cite><!--Link to UALR Page --> </blockquote><!-- Allows me to cite lengthy quotes -->
<p>Upon merging, various students began to attend the university and enroll in various undergraduate majors. To this day, there are <q>more than 100 undergraduate majors, an extensive schedule of night, weekend, and off‚Äêcampus classes, and a wide range of community educational services.</q> </p>
      
      <h3>What do students endure?</h3>
      
  <p>College is <em>hard. </em><!-- Styles text in italics --> Many students at UALR would agree; however, there are many things available for individuals to take advantage of while on campus. For instance, students can apply for on-campus jobs, the Military Student Success Center, tutoring, or even athletics. <strong>A lot</strong> of these things can be found at the Student Experience Center or the Donaghey Student Center. </p>
      
      <h3>What UALR Provides</h3>
      
<p>Here are a few example of the majors that the university provides by it's four colleges. </p>
