      <pp>Progressive enchancement is a web development technique that gives users a basic version of websites, regardless of what device or browser they're using. It starts with a simple core experience and then adds advanced features for users with modern browsers. The system guarantees content is accessible to all users, even those with older devices and disabilities. Progressive enhancement allows websites to adapt to new technologies and remain operational even when certain features are not supported.</pp>
